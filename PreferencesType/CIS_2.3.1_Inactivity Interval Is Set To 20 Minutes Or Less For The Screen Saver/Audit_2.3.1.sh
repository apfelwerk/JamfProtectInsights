# Title: Inactivity Interval Is Set To 20 Minutes Or Less For The Screen Saver
# CIS Nr.: 2.3.1
# Level: 1
# Type: Preferences
# Info: A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screensaver starts after a value is selected in the drop down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts.
# Rationale: Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time.
