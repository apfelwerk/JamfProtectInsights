# Inactivity Interval Is Set To 20 Minutes Or Less For The Screen Saver
#### Benchmark Information
- CIS Nr.: 2.3.1
- Level: 1
- Type: Preferences
------------------------
## Description

A locking screensaver is one of the standard security controls to limit access to a computer and the current user's session when the computer is temporarily unused or unattended. In macOS, the screensaver starts after a value is selected in the drop down menu. 20 minutes or less is an acceptable value. Any value can be selected through the command line or script but a number that is not reflected in the GUI can be problematic. 20 minutes is the default for new accounts.

## Rationale

Setting an inactivity interval for the screensaver prevents unauthorized persons from viewing a system left unattended for an extensive period of time.

## Impact

If the screensaver is not set users may leave the computer available for an unauthorized person to access information.
