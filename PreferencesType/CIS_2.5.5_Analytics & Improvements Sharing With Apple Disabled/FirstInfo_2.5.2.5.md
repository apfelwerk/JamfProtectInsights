# Analytics & Improvements Sharing With Apple Disabled
#### Benchmark Information
- CIS Nr.: 2.5.2.5
- Level: 2
- Type: Preferences
------------------------
## Description

Apple provides a mechanism to send diagnostic and analytics data back to Apple to help them improve the platform. Information sent to Apple may contain internal organizational information that should be controlled and not available for processing by Apple. Turn off all Analytics and Improvements sharing.

## Rationale

Organizations should have knowledge of what is shared with the vendor and the setting automatically forwards information to Apple.
