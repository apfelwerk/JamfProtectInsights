# Audit: Run the following commands to verify that Internet Sharing is not set
sudo defaults read /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/com.apple.nat | grep -i Enabled
# Verify that the output does not include Enabled = 1

# Note: If the settings has not been changed from the default, then this audit will fail on the command line. Follow the remediation instructions to verify that it is set to a disabled status.
