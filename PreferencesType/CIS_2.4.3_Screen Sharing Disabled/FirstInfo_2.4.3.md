# Screen Sharing Disabled
#### Benchmark Information
- CIS Nr.: 2.4.3
- Level: 1
- Type: Preferences
------------------------
## Description

Screen Sharing allows a computer to connect to another computer on a network and display the computer’s screen. While sharing the computer’s screen, the user can control what happens on that computer, such as opening documents or applications, opening, moving, or closing windows, and even shutting down the computer

## Rationale

Disabling Screen Sharing mitigates the risk of remote connections being made without the user of the console knowing that they are sharing the computer.
