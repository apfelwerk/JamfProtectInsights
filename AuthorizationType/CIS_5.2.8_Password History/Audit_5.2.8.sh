# Title: Password History
# CIS Nr.: 5.2.8
# Level: 1
# Type:Authorization
# Info: To reduce the risk of exposure and to decrease the incentives of password reuse (passwords that are not forced to be changed periodically generally are not ever changed) users must reset passwords periodically. This control ensures that previous passwords are not reused immediately by keeping a history of previous password hashes

# Rationale: Old passwords should not be reused.
