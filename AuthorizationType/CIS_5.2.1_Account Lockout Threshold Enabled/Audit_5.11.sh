# CIS Nr.: 5.2.1

# Info: The account lockout threshold specifies the amount of times a user can enter an incorrect password before a lockout will occur.
#   Ensure that a lockout threshold is part of the password policy on the computer.
# Rationale: The account lockout feature mitigates brute-force password attacks on the system.
