# Security Auditing Enabled
#### Benchmark Information
- CIS Nr.: 3.1
- Level: 1
- Type: Auditing
------------------------
## Description

macOS's audit facility, ```auditd```, receives notifications from the kernel when certain system calls, such as ```open```, ```fork```, and ```exit```, are made. These notifications are captured and written to an audit log.

## Rationale

Logs generated by ```auditd``` may be useful when investigating a security incident as they may help reveal the vulnerable application and the actions taken by a malicious actor.
